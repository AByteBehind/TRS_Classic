TRS-80 Model III/4 Network 3 Hard Disk Operating System
File created using a TRS-80 Model 4 Hard Disk Drive (15MB) Tandon TM503 6 Heads, 306 Cylnders

This is the Network 3 Operating System built on LDOS 5.1.3 preconfigured and installed in a hard disk image file used in the MFM Hard Disk Emulator created by David Gesswein. (Thank you Wizard!)

--> Initialization Floppy is Needed <--

LDOS 5.1.3 Hard Drives are initialized using a floppy disk that has a customized configuration of the logical setup of the hard disk and floppy disk drives on the host. The Diskette Image created using ImageDisk is included here, and recommended multiple copies are created (they are unique to the hard disk image).

Logical Drive Setup: This file is a 15MB Image, broken into 6 logical hard drives, around 2.4MB each:

Disk 0: - Contains all of the required software to run the Network 3, files are copied here and must remain in disk 0.
- NBASIC and related programs (MAILBOX, etc)
- HOST/CMD - The hosting (server side program)
- Other files to support NET2, etc.
Disk 1: - Blank

Disk 2: - Blank

Disk 3: - Blank

Disk 4: - The first floppy disk (Drive 0) on the host

Disk 5: - The first floppy disk (Drive 1) on the host

Disk 6: - Blank
